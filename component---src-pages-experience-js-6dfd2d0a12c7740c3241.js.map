I was tasked with developing the user\r\n          interface for several mobile products using the Flutter framework,\r\n          including a UI component library. This required collaborating not only\r\n          with my teammates, but also with other teams across the company,\r\n          including the UX team.

I\r\n          took responsibility for most accessibility-related tasks, including\r\n          ensuring full compatibility with native accessibility services,\r\n          auditing the applications to find any outstanding issues, and creating\r\n          responsive apps that worked on devices of all sizes. Towards the end\r\n          of my internship, I also gave a presentation teaching other company\r\n          developers the basics of accessibility and how to create accessible\r\n          apps with Flutter.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <Carousel\r\n          naturalSlideWidth={1170}\r\n          naturalSlideHeight={2532}\r\n          imgs={[QNoteInbox, FlutterUILibrary, QChatReact]}\r\n          alts={[\r\n            \"QNote inbox screenshot\",\r\n            \"Flutter UI Component Library screenshot\",\r\n            \"QChat chat screen screenshot\",\r\n          ]}\r\n        />\r\n        <SocialMediaBanner />\r\n      </main>\r\n    </ContentLayout>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const Head = () => (\r\n  <title>Work Experience | Mart√≠n Cuesta Allende</title>\r\n);\r\n\r\n// Step 3: Export your component\r\nexport default ExperiencePage;\r\n"],"names":["Head","to","naturalSlideWidth","naturalSlideHeight","imgs","QNoteInbox","FlutterUILibrary","QChatReact","alts"],"sourceRoot":""}
