I was tasked with developing the\r\n              user interface for several mobile products using the Flutter\r\n              framework, including a UI component library. This required\r\n              collaborating not only with my teammates, but also with other\r\n              teams across the company, including the UX team. You can check the\r\n              projects I worked on <Link to=\"/projects\">here</Link>.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              During my time at Zebra I mainly focused on building\r\n              accessibility. I took responsibility for most\r\n              accessibility-related tasks, including ensuring full compatibility\r\n              with native accessibility services, auditing the applications to\r\n              find any outstanding issues, and creating responsive apps that\r\n              worked on devices of all sizes. Towards the end of my internship,\r\n              I also gave a presentation teaching other company developers the\r\n              basics of accessibility and how to create accessible apps with\r\n              Flutter.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"carouselFlexBox\">\r\n            <Carousel\r\n              naturalSlideWidth={1170}\r\n              naturalSlideHeight={2532}\r\n              imgs={[QNoteInbox, FlutterUILibrary, QChatReact]}\r\n              alts={[\r\n                \"QNote inbox screenshot\",\r\n                \"Flutter UI Component Library screenshot\",\r\n                \"QChat chat screen screenshot\",\r\n              ]}\r\n            />\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <SocialMediaBanner />\r\n      </main>\r\n    </ContentLayout>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/FlutterUILibrary-a445eb8a4bf4f0f3ec38be389ee47e63.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/QChatReact-181d2b5b8c87438d1a342113a8e4fda6.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/QNoteInbox-7e6886af8428c645a23760010081570b.png\";"],"names":["Head","ExperiencePage","to","href","target","rel","class","naturalSlideWidth","naturalSlideHeight","imgs","QNoteInbox","FlutterUILibrary","QChatReact","alts"],"sourceRoot":""}
