              EventLite is a website that allows users to browse, create, and discover events
              and venues, built during my second year at 
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" style="color: #6B2C91">The University of Manchester</a>,

            <p>
              EventLite was a group project built during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in which we
              had to fulfill weekly client requirements. Using 
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://go.java/?intcmp=gojava-banner-java-com" style="color: #007396">Java</a>
              and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://spring.io/" style="color: #6db33f">Spring</a>
              framework for the backend, and 
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://getbootstrap.com/" style="color: #7952b3">Bootstrap</a>
              for the frontend, we were able to coordinate the work through
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://about.gitlab.com/" style="color: #fa7035">GitLab</a>
              and deliver a product fulfilling expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's talk about the <b>backend</b> in more detail. The class mandated that we used Spring, 
              as we were all experienced in Java. Despite the fact that none of us had encountered
              this framework before, we were able to quickly adapt and exploit it to the fullest
              to fulfill requirements. Thanks to Spring, we were able to provide a REST API that
              could be used to access and view our persistent data model.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our <b>frontend</b> was built using Bootstrap, as I already had experience using this 
              library from previous projects. 
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/" style="color: #005f0f">Thymeleaf</a>
              was used to integrate the backend with the frontend. Sadly, the UI and UX didn't
              end as polished as I originally intended, described below, due to time constraints
              caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was also regularly in charge of developing <b>unit and integration tests</b>.
              Using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://junit.org/junit5/" style="color: #dc524a">JUnit</a>
              I ensured that all features worked as inteded, and that no exploits through bad data
              were possible.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
              While the team started work on the project in Manchester, we had to quickly
              adapt to working remotely due to <b>COVID-19</b>. This transition was easy to make 
              as we were already using GitLab to organise our work. Creating issues and merge
              requests, while employing separate branches for each feature before merging into 
              master made hitting our targets easy. We also used videoconferences to discuss
              how to solve problems and to coordinate our work.

                    border-left: 7px solid #020659;

                UI and UX
              </h1>
            </span>
            <p>
              During the first weeks of development we were tasked with producing <b>UI mockups</b>
              for an event seeker perspective. Using
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" style="color: #470137">Adobe XD</a>
              I produced multiple artboards along planning the user flow. My intent was to create 
              a clean and easy to use website, where the important information was immediately 
              accessible. I also created a simple, modern branding to ensure consistency among
              all pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because requirements were only handed to us weekly, many of the features I had 
              originally envisioned to be in the website, like the event image thumbnails, weren't
              included. As none of the requirements talked about UI, frontend development
              got pushed to the side. Combined with a shortened development time due to COVID-19,
              this meant that much of the final UI was not up to my standards in terms of polish.
              However, I'm still prooud that some personality shines through the UI, despite
              the difficulties encountered.
