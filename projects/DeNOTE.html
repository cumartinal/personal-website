              DeNOTE was developed during my first year at
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" style="color: #6B2C91">The University of Manchester</a>,
              for COMP 10120, in which we had to develop a data-oriented web application.
            </p>
            <p>
              As university students constantly sharing lecture notes through apps like Messenger or Whatsapp, we felt that
              we could develop a more practical way to do this.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
              It's true that similar websites exist, but these hide the majority of
              documents behind a paywall. We also wanted to add a <b>social</b> aspect to our product
              which other websites lack. If you know one of your friends creates great
              study material, you could follow them on DeNOTE to have easy access to their notes.
              If you had any questions about a document, you could simply ask them in the 
              comments section. Need to access notes offline? Simply download them
              for later use.

            <p>
              While everyone in the team worked in both the front- and backend, we decided to
              split the group into two. As I was a Human Computer Interaction student, I had
              a lot of responsibilities in the front-end department, alongside some back-end
              and non development tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's first talk about the <b>backend</b>. Built using 
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mysql.com" style="color: #00758f">mySQL</a>,
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" style="color: #f29221">SQL</a>,
              and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.php.net/" style="color: #8892bf">PHP</a>,
              our database was used to store notes in PDF and image formats, as well as storing user profiles.
              A lot of care was used when designing the tables we'd use, as we knew that every
              design decision could have many consequences further in development.
            </p>
            <p>
              To develop an accessible, intuitive, and modern front-end we used 
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://getbootstrap.com/" style="color: #7952b3">Bootstrap</a>
              alongside custom
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" style="color: #000000">JavaScript</a>.
              After <b>prototyping</b> the flow and design of the website, development of our <b>frontend</b>
              went smoothly. Building a mobile accessible website was essential, as we believed 
              that's how most students would use it: in the bus before an exam. In the end, our
              efforts paid off as we were voted the "application with the Most Appealing User Interface"
              by the other students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, a project of this scope didn't only involve development tasks. I was also
              in charge of legal considerations, such as Terms and Conditions, and planning how
              to handle copyright claims and user reports. I was also often in charge of handling
              complaints within the group about other team members and task distribution.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
              The last part of development was used for polishing the product, in which I refined
              the UI and fixed a potential SQL injection exploit.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="ui" id="ui" style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 2rem;">
            <span>
              <h1 style="border-bottom: 7px solid #6B2C91;
                    border-left: 7px solid #6B2C91;
                    padding-left: 7px;">
                UI
              </h1>
            </span>
            <p>
              One of my main motivations in pursuing a career in Human Computer Interaction was 
              due to my interest in <b>accessibility</b>. Because of this, a lot of care was 
              given to the UI and the UX.
            </p>
            <p>
              We wanted DeNOTE to work on any device regardless of viewport size. It wasn't a 
              mobile-first nor a desktop-first approach, but a mix of both. This is why we chose to use
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://getbootstrap.com/" style="color: #7952b3">Bootstrap</a>,
              which made developing a responsive website easy and fast.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make our website sleek and modern we looked at how other websites had solved
              the same issues we had, but applying our own twist to it. For example, the visual
              card organisation in the subjects page was inspired by how image thumbnails are 
              presented in an Instagram profile.
            </p>
            <p>
              After developing mockups, we started to design our own <b>branding</b>. As this was a tool 
              meant for students in our university, the colour branding is heavily based in the purple
              of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" style="color: #6B2C91">The University of Manchester</a>.
              The fonts <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Montserrat</a>
              and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;">Lato</a>
              were chosen because of how they paired together and their easy legibility at all sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the name DeNOTE is a stylized mesh of "The Note", inspired by the verb
              "to denote", to stand for, to make known. From there, the tagline "sharing DeNOTEs
              you need" was an easy play on words to come up with.
