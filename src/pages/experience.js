          in their business operations.

          I performed data engineering, combining data from multiple sources and
          assessed the accuracy of their manual resource planning and
          forecasting methods through time series analysis. I also created a
          tool for automated analysis and outlined recommendations to improve
          the current system and better integrate data science methods. Further

            <p>
              I did a one-year internship at Zebra Technologies, in London,
              working as a Front-end developer. I was tasked with developing the
              user interface for several mobile products using the Flutter
              framework, including a UI component library. This required
              collaborating not only with my teammates, but also with other
              teams across the company, including the UX team. You can check the
              projects I worked on <Link to="/projects">here</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time at Zebra I mainly focused on building
              accessibility. I took responsibility for most
              accessibility-related tasks, including ensuring full compatibility
              with native accessibility services, auditing the applications to
              find any outstanding issues, and creating responsive apps that
              worked on devices of all sizes. Towards the end of my internship,
              I also gave a presentation teaching other company developers the
              basics of accessibility and how to create accessible apps with
              Flutter.
